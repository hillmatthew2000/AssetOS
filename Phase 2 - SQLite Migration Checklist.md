# AssetOS Database Migration: In-Memory → SQLite
## Phase 2 Validation Checklist

---

## 📋 Database Setup & Initialization

- [ ] SQLite database file created in correct location (%LocalAppData%\ITAM\itam.db)
- [ ] Database schema matches expected structure (Assets, Users tables)
- [ ] All foreign key relationships properly configured
- [ ] Initial seed data (users and sample assets) correctly populated
- [ ] Database file permissions allow read/write operations

## 💾 Data Persistence Validation

- [ ] Create Test: New asset persists after application restart
- [ ] Update Test: Modified asset properties retain changes after restart
- [ ] Delete Test: Deleted assets remain deleted after restart
- [ ] Assignment Test: User-asset assignments persist after restart
- [ ] Status Test: Asset status changes persist after restart

## 🔗 Relationship Integrity Checks

- [ ] One-to-many relationship: User → multiple assets works correctly
- [ ] Foreign key constraints enforced (can't assign non-existent user)
- [ ] DeleteBehavior.SetNull: User deletion unassigns assets (sets AssignedUserId to null)
- [ ] DeleteBehavior.Restrict: Can't delete user who has updated assets
- [ ] Navigation properties load correctly (eager loading works)

## ⚙️ CRUD Operations Validation

- [ ] Create: All asset types (Laptop/Desktop/Server) created successfully
- [ ] Read: Asset retrieval by ID works correctly
- [ ] Read: Asset listing with filtering (by status, type, user) works
- [ ] Update: All asset properties updateable (including FKs)
- [ ] Delete: Asset removal works and cascades correctly
- [ ] Bulk Operations: Multiple asset operations in sequence work

## 🚨 Error Handling & Edge Cases

- [ ] Duplicate AssetTag/SerialNumber validation works
- [ ] Invalid user assignment prevented
- [ ] Invalid date/time values handled gracefully
- [ ] Null reference exceptions prevented
- [ ] Database connection errors handled
- [ ] Empty database scenario (no assets/users) works
- [ ] Maximum string length constraints enforced

## 🖥️ Console UI Functionality

- [ ] All menu options execute correctly
- [ ] User input validation works (invalid choices rejected)
- [ ] Asset listing displays correctly (formatting, pagination if needed)
- [ ] Warranty expiry report generates accurate results
- [ ] User listing shows all users correctly
- [ ] Asset assignment flow works end-to-end

## ⚡ Performance & Concurrency

- [ ] Response time acceptable with 100+ assets
- [ ] Database operations complete within reasonable time
- [ ] Multiple rapid operations don't cause conflicts
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable during operations

## 📊 Data Type Compatibility

- [ ] DateTime fields store/retrieve correctly (no timezone issues)
- [ ] Decimal fields (PurchasePrice) maintain precision
- [ ] Enum fields (AssetType, AssetStatus) convert correctly
- [ ] Boolean fields work as expected
- [ ] String fields handle special characters and Unicode

## 🗂️ Database File Management

- [ ] Database file created in intended directory structure
- [ ] Application handles missing database file (creates new one)
- [ ] Application handles existing database file (uses existing)
- [ ] Database file size reasonable for data volume
- [ ] File locking issues don't occur during operations

## 🔐 Security & Validation

- [ ] SQL injection prevention in place
- [ ] Input sanitization working
- [ ] Sensitive data not logged or exposed
- [ ] Database file has appropriate permissions
- [ ] Connection string doesn't expose credentials

## 🔄 Migration-Specific Tests

- [ ] Existing in-memory seed data transfers correctly
- [ ] No data loss during migration process
- [ ] Relationship integrity maintained after migration
- [ ] Application behavior identical to in-memory version
- [ ] Performance equal to or better than in-memory

## 📈 Reporting & Analytics

- [ ] Warranty expiry report works with SQLite
- [ ] User asset assignment report works
- [ ] Asset status summary works
- [ ] Custom queries execute correctly
- [ ] Report generation time acceptable

## 🛠️ Service Layer Validation

- [ ] AssetService methods work with SQLite backend
- [ ] UserService methods work with SQLite backend
- [ ] Service exceptions handled correctly
- [ ] Business logic unchanged from in-memory version
- [ ] Dependency injection works with new context

## 📝 Documentation & Deployment

- [ ] README updated with SQLite configuration
- [ ] Database file location documented
- [ ] Migration steps documented
- [ ] Application deployment instructions updated
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide updated for SQLite

## ✅ Final Validation

- [ ] All Phase 1 functionality preserved
- [ ] No regression in existing features
- [ ] New SQLite-specific features working
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] User acceptance testing completed
- [ ] Backup/restore procedures tested (if applicable)
- [ ] **Ready for production deployment**
