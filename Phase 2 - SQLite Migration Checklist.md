# AssetOS Database Migration: In-Memory → SQLite
## Phase 2 Validation Checklist

---

## 📋 Database Setup & Initialization

- [x] SQLite database file created in correct location (%LocalAppData%\ITAM\itam.db)
- [x] Database schema matches expected structure (Assets, Users tables)
- [x] All foreign key relationships properly configured
- [x] Initial seed data (users and sample assets) correctly populated
- [x] Database file permissions allow read/write operations

## 💾 Data Persistence Validation

- [x] Create Test: New asset persists after application restart
- [x] Update Test: Modified asset properties retain changes after restart
- [x] Delete Test: Deleted assets remain deleted after restart
- [x] Assignment Test: User-asset assignments persist after restart
- [x] Status Test: Asset status changes persist after restart

## 🔗 Relationship Integrity Checks

- [x] One-to-many relationship: User → multiple assets works correctly
- [x] Foreign key constraints enforced (can't assign non-existent user)
- [x] DeleteBehavior.SetNull: User deletion unassigns assets (sets AssignedUserId to null)
- [x] DeleteBehavior.Restrict: Can't delete user who has updated assets
- [x] Navigation properties load correctly (eager loading works)

## ⚙️ CRUD Operations Validation

- [x] Create: All asset types (Laptop/Desktop/Server) created successfully
- [x] Read: Asset retrieval by ID works correctly
- [x] Read: Asset listing with filtering (by status, type, user) works
- [x] Update: All asset properties updateable (including FKs)
- [x] Delete: Asset removal works and cascades correctly
- [x] Bulk Operations: Multiple asset operations in sequence work

## 🚨 Error Handling & Edge Cases

- [x] Duplicate AssetTag/SerialNumber validation works
- [x] Invalid user assignment prevented
- [x] Invalid date/time values handled gracefully
- [x] Null reference exceptions prevented
- [x] Database connection errors handled
- [x] Empty database scenario (no assets/users) works
- [x] Maximum string length constraints enforced

## 🖥️ Console UI Functionality

- [x] All menu options execute correctly
- [x] User input validation works (invalid choices rejected)
- [x] Asset listing displays correctly (formatting, pagination if needed)
- [x] Warranty expiry report generates accurate results
- [x] User listing shows all users correctly
- [x] Asset assignment flow works end-to-end

## ⚡ Performance & Concurrency

- [x] Response time acceptable with 100+ assets
- [x] Database operations complete within reasonable time
- [x] Multiple rapid operations don't cause conflicts
- [x] Memory usage remains stable during operations

## 📊 Data Type Compatibility

- [x] DateTime fields store/retrieve correctly (no timezone issues)
- [x] Decimal fields (PurchasePrice) maintain precision
- [x] Enum fields (AssetType, AssetStatus) convert correctly
- [x] Boolean fields work as expected
- [x] String fields handle special characters and Unicode

## 🗂️ Database File Management

- [x] Database file created in intended directory structure
- [x] Application handles missing database file (creates new one)
- [x] Application handles existing database file (uses existing)
- [x] Database file size reasonable for data volume
- [x] File locking issues don't occur during operations

## 🔐 Security & Validation

- [x] SQL injection prevention in place
- [x] Input sanitization working
- [x] Sensitive data not logged or exposed
- [x] Database file has appropriate permissions
- [x] Connection string doesn't expose credentials

## 🔄 Migration-Specific Tests

- [x] Existing in-memory seed data transfers correctly
- [x] No data loss during migration process
- [x] Relationship integrity maintained after migration
- [x] Application behavior identical to in-memory version
- [x] Performance equal to or better than in-memory

## 📈 Reporting & Analytics

- [x] Warranty expiry report works with SQLite
- [x] User asset assignment report works
- [x] Asset status summary works
- [x] Custom queries execute correctly
- [x] Report generation time acceptable

## 🛠️ Service Layer Validation

- [x] AssetService methods work with SQLite backend
- [x] UserService methods work with SQLite backend
- [x] Service exceptions handled correctly
- [x] Business logic unchanged from in-memory version
- [x] Dependency injection works with new context

## 📝 Documentation & Deployment

- [x] README updated with SQLite configuration
- [x] Database file location documented
- [x] Migration steps documented
- [x] Application deployment instructions updated
- [x] Troubleshooting guide updated for SQLite

## ✅ Final Validation

- [x] All Phase 1 functionality preserved
- [x] No regression in existing features
- [x] New SQLite-specific features working
- [x] Performance benchmarks met
- [x] User acceptance testing completed
- [x] Backup/restore procedures tested (if applicable)
- [x] **Ready for production deployment**
