# AssetOS Database Migration: In-Memory → SQLite
## Phase 2 Validation Checklist

---

## 📋 Database Setup & Initialization

- ✅ SQLite database file created in correct location (%LocalAppData%\ConsoleApp\itam.db)
- ✅ Database schema matches expected structure (Assets, Users tables)
- ✅ All foreign key relationships properly configured
- ✅ Initial seed data (users and sample assets) correctly populated
- ✅ Database file permissions allow read/write operations

## 💾 Data Persistence Validation

- ✅ Create Test: New asset persists after application restart
- ✅ Update Test: Modified asset properties retain changes after restart
- ✅ Delete Test: Deleted assets remain deleted after restart
- ✅ Assignment Test: User-asset assignments persist after restart
- ✅ Status Test: Asset status changes persist after restart

## 🔗 Relationship Integrity Checks

- ✅ One-to-many relationship: User → multiple assets works correctly
- ✅ Foreign key constraints enforced (can't assign non-existent user)
- ✅ DeleteBehavior.SetNull: User deletion unassigns assets (sets AssignedUserId to null)
- ✅ DeleteBehavior.Restrict: Can't delete user who has updated assets
- ✅ Navigation properties load correctly (eager loading works)

## ⚙️ CRUD Operations Validation

- ✅ Create: All asset types (Laptop/Desktop/Server) created successfully
- ✅ Read: Asset retrieval by ID works correctly
- ✅ Read: Asset listing with filtering (by status, type, user) works
- ✅ Update: All asset properties updateable (including FKs)
- ✅ Delete: Asset removal works and cascades correctly
- ✅ Bulk Operations: Multiple asset operations in sequence work

## 🚨 Error Handling & Edge Cases

- ✅ Duplicate AssetTag/SerialNumber validation works
- ✅ Invalid user assignment prevented
- ✅ Invalid date/time values handled gracefully
- ✅ Null reference exceptions prevented
- ✅ Database connection errors handled
- ✅ Empty database scenario (no assets/users) works
- ✅ Maximum string length constraints enforced

## 🖥️ Console UI Functionality

- ✅ All menu options execute correctly
- ✅ User input validation works (invalid choices rejected)
- ✅ Asset listing displays correctly (formatting, pagination if needed)
- ✅ Warranty expiry report generates accurate results
- ✅ User listing shows all users correctly
- ✅ Asset assignment flow works end-to-end

## ⚡ Performance & Concurrency

- ✅ Response time acceptable with 100+ assets
- ✅ Database operations complete within reasonable time
- ✅ Multiple rapid operations don't cause conflicts
- ✅ Memory usage remains stable during operations

## 📊 Data Type Compatibility

- ✅ DateTime fields store/retrieve correctly (no timezone issues)
- ✅ Decimal fields (PurchasePrice) maintain precision
- ✅ Enum fields (AssetType, AssetStatus) convert correctly
- ✅ Boolean fields work as expected
- ✅ String fields handle special characters and Unicode

## 🗂️ Database File Management

- ✅ Database file created in intended directory structure
- ✅ Application handles missing database file (creates new one)
- ✅ Application handles existing database file (uses existing)
- ✅ Database file size reasonable for data volume
- ✅ File locking issues don't occur during operations

## 🔐 Security & Validation

- ✅ SQL injection prevention in place
- ✅ Input sanitization working
- ✅ Sensitive data not logged or exposed
- ✅ Database file has appropriate permissions
- ✅ Connection string doesn't expose credentials

## 🔄 Migration-Specific Tests

- ✅ Existing in-memory seed data transfers correctly
- ✅ No data loss during migration process
- ✅ Relationship integrity maintained after migration
- ✅ Application behavior identical to in-memory version
- ✅ Performance equal to or better than in-memory

## 📈 Reporting & Analytics

- ✅ Warranty expiry report works with SQLite
- ✅ User asset assignment report works
- ✅ Asset status summary works
- ✅ Custom queries execute correctly
- ✅ Report generation time acceptable

## 🛠️ Service Layer Validation

- ✅ AssetService methods work with SQLite backend
- ✅ UserService methods work with SQLite backend
- ✅ Service exceptions handled correctly
- ✅ Business logic unchanged from in-memory version
- ✅ Dependency injection works with new context

## 📝 Documentation & Deployment

- ✅ README updated with SQLite configuration
- ✅ Database file location documented
- ✅ Migration steps documented
- ✅ Application deployment instructions updated
- ✅ Troubleshooting guide updated for SQLite

## ✅ Final Validation

- ✅ All Phase 1 functionality preserved
- ✅ No regression in existing features
- ✅ New SQLite-specific features working
- ✅ Performance benchmarks met
- ✅ User acceptance testing completed
- ✅ Backup/restore procedures tested (if applicable)
- ✅ **Ready for production deployment**
